# GoMechanic

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.
You NEED to download Angular and Node.js including whatever tools are required to run this to create an angular project to put the source code into for it to function correctly.
<br>

You also need to install [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/) for the .json files to load the CSS correctly.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
